# Contributing to Ratchet

Ratchet is an effect gate: an agent asks permission before doing something it
cannot take back, and gets a durable answer. That makes correctness a safety
property rather than a preference, so the bar here is a little unusual and worth
knowing before you start.

**Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) first.** It is the project contract — the invariants,
the domain vocabulary, the concurrency rules, and the things that must stay true.
Every claim in it is enforced by a test or a config check. If you break one, a
test fails: fix the code, not the test.

## Getting set up

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:db          # Postgres on :5433, needs Docker
npm run migrate
npm run dev             # control plane on :8787
npm run dev:worker      # lease reaper + webhook delivery
```

`npm test` runs typecheck, unit, integration and e2e against a disposable
database. It needs Docker. Integration and e2e share one database and run
single-threaded on purpose — the worker's sweeps are global.

## Reporting a bug

Open a GitHub issue with what you did, what happened, and what you expected.
A failing test is the best possible bug report and is always welcome.

**Do not open a public issue for a security problem.** See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — mail security@ratchetgate.com or use GitHub's
private vulnerability reporting.

## Proposing a change

Open an issue before a large change, so nobody spends a weekend on something
that will not be merged. Small fixes can go straight to a pull request.

**Everything goes through a pull request with an approving review** — including
changes by the maintainer. `main` carries a ruleset with no bypass actors, so
nobody can push to it directly. If your pull request sits waiting on a review,
that is the same queue everyone else is in, not a comment on the change.

Pull requests should:

1. **Pass `npm test` in full.** Typecheck, unit, integration, e2e.
2. **Come with a test at the right layer.** Unit for pure logic, integration for
   anything touching Postgres, e2e for anything crossing HTTP. A change to state
   transitions, authorization, tenant isolation, idempotency, rate limits,
   billing, SSRF, webhook signing or lease fencing **must** have one.
3. **Update `src/api/schemas.ts`** if the wire contract changed, so the published
   OpenAPI document stays accurate.
4. **Update the relevant `docs/handoff/*.md`.** Those are living memory, not a
   release artifact.
5. **Leave no claim untrue** in the README, the web pages, or the manifest.

## House style

- **Comments explain _why_.** The code already says what.
- TypeScript strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` on, ESM with `.js` extensions in
  relative imports.
- Wire format is `snake_case`; the domain is `camelCase`. Conversion happens in
  `src/api/serialize.ts` and nowhere else.
- Money is integer micro-USD. Never floats.
- Do not claim coverage percentages — no coverage tool is configured. Do not
  claim measured performance without running `scripts/bench.ts` and quoting the
  real output.

## Things that are not up for negotiation

- **Exactly-once is never claimed.** It is not achievable. At-most-once
  initiation is, and it is enforced by a database unique index rather than by
  application logic.
- **An unknown outcome stays unknown.** A lease that expires unreported becomes
  `indeterminate` and is never auto-resolved to a guess.
- **Only a payload fingerprint is stored**, never the payload.
- **Ratchet never performs the side effect.** It holds no vendor credentials and
  has no outbound access to customer systems. That boundary is the product.

## Licence

By contributing you agree that your contributions are licensed under the
[Apache License 2.0](LICENSE), the same licence as the project.

## Certificate of origin

Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` line. It certifies the
[Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/) — in
short, that you wrote the change or otherwise have the right to submit it under
the project's licence, and that you understand the contribution and the record
of it are public and permanent.

**If you have a day job, read that sentence again before you sign it.** Many
employment agreements assign your employer the copyright in code you write,
sometimes including code written on your own time or on your own machine. Where
that applies, the right to submit is your employer's to give, not yours, and a
sign-off is a statement you are not in a position to make. This is not a
formality invented here — it is the most common way a contribution turns into a
problem months later, for the contributor rather than the project.

Contributing on your own equipment and your own time is usually enough. Where
it is not, or where you are unsure, get it in writing from your employer first.
We would rather wait for that than accept a change we may later have to remove.

Git adds the line for you:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your message"
```

It appends `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email>`, taken from your `user.name`
and `user.email`. Use a real name and a real address — the point of the
assertion is that somebody made it.

To make it automatic in this repository, use a hook — there is no `git config`
that does this. `format.signOff` looks like the setting and is not: it applies
to `git format-patch`, never to `git commit`.

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg <<'HOOK'
#!/bin/sh
# Append Signed-off-by unless one is already present.
grep -qiE '^Signed-off-by: ' "$1" || \
  printf '\nSigned-off-by: %s <%s>\n' "$(git config user.name)" "$(git config user.email)" >> "$1"
HOOK
chmod +x .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
```

Forgot on the last commit:

```bash
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
```

A pull request whose commits are missing the line is rejected by CI, which
checks the commits the pull request adds rather than the whole history — the
requirement starts here and is not applied retroactively to work that predates
it.
