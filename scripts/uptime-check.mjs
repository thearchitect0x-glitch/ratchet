 * Synthetic monitoring for Ratchet.
 *
 * "Is the port open" is not what needs watching here. The failure that hurts is
 * the SILENT one: the worker stops expiring leases, so effects sit at pending
 * for ever and every retry is answered in_flight — with the site up, the
 * database healthy, and every status page green.
 *
 * So this drives the actual product. It asks the gate for a decision and checks
 * the decision is right, which is the only thing that proves Ratchet is doing
 * its job rather than merely responding.
 *
 * COST. The idempotency key rotates daily, so exactly one metered effect is
 * created per day; every probe after the first that day is a duplicate, and
 * duplicates are free by design. Thirty gated effects a month against a free
 * allowance of a thousand.
