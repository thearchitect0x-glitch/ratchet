> An effect gate for AI agents. Ask before you act; Ratchet answers durably so the
> same real-world side effect is attempted at most once, stays inside a declared
> budget, and leaves an auditable record.

## The problem
Agents retry. LLM control flow is non-deterministic, network calls fail ambiguously,
and processes crash mid-action. The result is duplicate emails, double charges, and
repeated writes. Vendor-side idempotency keys only help for the few vendors that
offer them, and never across separate agent processes or model providers.

## The core loop
1. POST ${config.publicUrl}/v1/effects/begin
   { "effect_type": "email.send", "idempotency_key": "welcome:user_123", "payload": {...} }
2. Branch on the returned "decision":
   - execute            -> you hold the lease. Do the action, then report.
   - duplicate          -> already done. Replay "result". Do NOT act.
   - in_flight          -> another caller holds a live lease. Back off.
   - blocked            -> a prior attempt's outcome is unknown. Verify, then resolve.
   - approval_required  -> an operator must approve first.
   - denied             -> policy or budget refused it.
3. POST ${config.publicUrl}/v1/effects/{effect_id}/report
   { "lease_token": "...", "outcome": "succeeded", "result": {...} }

## Do not rely on being asked
A gate only stops the agents that call it. When Ratchet answers "execute" it also
returns vendor_idempotency_key: the key the VENDOR deduplicates on. Send it to
Stripe, Square, Adyen, PayPal — and the vendor refuses the duplicate itself, even
if some other process never calls Ratchet at all.
  "vendor_idempotency_key": { "key": "rtk_...", "placement": "Idempotency-Key header",
                              "enforced": true }
When "enforced" is false the vendor does not deduplicate and the gate stays
advisory. That field is the truth; do not assume it.

## When an agent starts looping
Spend ceilings catch an agent burning money. They do not catch one doing too MUCH,
which is usually free: five thousand emails instead of three costs about a dollar.
A per-effect-type circuit breaker opens when volume passes a ceiling, and the
default response is to hold the work for a human rather than kill you. If a begin
returns approval_required or denied citing a circuit breaker: STOP creating that
effect type. Retrying will not help. Do not rename the effect type, split the work
across keys, or vary the idempotency key to get around it — that defeats a control
protecting the people your actions reach. Call ratchet_get_circuit (MCP) or
GET /v1/circuits to see when it clears.

## The important part
If your process dies between step 2 and step 3, Ratchet does NOT silently let the
next caller retry. The lease expires and the effect becomes "indeterminate" — a
known unknown. Your configured policy for that effect type decides what happens:
block (default), retry (only for vendors that are genuinely idempotent), or probe
(a caller must verify reality first). Duplicates stop being invisible.

## Endpoints
- POST   /v1/workspaces                    create a workspace + first API key
- POST   /v1/effects/begin                 the gate (this is the metered call)
- POST   /v1/effects/{id}/report           close out a leased effect
- POST   /v1/effects/{id}/resolve          settle an indeterminate effect
- POST   /v1/effects/{id}/cancel           cancel an effect that has not run
- GET    /v1/effects/lookup                find by effect_type + idempotency_key (free)
- GET    /v1/effects                       list recent effects
- GET/PUT /v1/policies/{effect_type}       per-effect-type policy
- GET    /v1/workspace                     plan, credit balance, usage
- GET    /v1/billing/plans                 pricing
- GET    /v1/circuits                      open circuit breakers + your own volume
- POST   /v1/circuits/{effect_type}/open   emergency stop ("*" = the whole workspace)
- GET    /v1/effects/{id}/receipts         signed receipts for one effect
- GET    /v1/receipts/audit                verify your chain end to end
- GET    /v1/vendors                       does a vendor deduplicate? (free, no key)
- GET    /workerz                          is lease expiry running? 503 if not

## Authentication
Authorization: Bearer rk_test_<prefix>_<secret>   (or X-API-Key)
Keys are scoped. An executing agent needs only effects:begin and effects:report.

## Idempotency keys
Derive the key from the work itself, never from a random value or a timestamp.
Good:  "invoice:2026-08:acct_88123"   "welcome-email:user_123"
Bad:   uuid4()                        "send-" + Date.now()

## MCP
Streamable HTTP: ${config.publicUrl}/mcp
Tools: ${MCP_TOOLS.map((t) => t.name).join(', ')}

## Pricing
Meter: one "gated effect" = the first begin() for an (effect_type, idempotency_key).
Duplicate suppression, retries, reports, and reads are free.
Free plan: ${PLANS.free.includedEffects.toLocaleString('en-US')} gated effects per month.

## Start with no key at all
Your very first call needs no credential. POST to /v1/effects/begin without an
Authorization header and you get a real decision plus a workspace and API key in the
response. Store the key; it is returned once. The workspace is capped until you claim
it with an email at POST /v1/workspaces/claim.

  curl -X POST ${config.publicUrl}/v1/effects/begin \\
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
    -d '{"effect_type":"email.send","idempotency_key":"welcome:user_123","payload":{}}'

## Free, no key required
Does a vendor actually refuse a repeated request? Most callers assume yes and are wrong.
  GET ${config.publicUrl}/v1/vendors            -> every vendor we have profiled
  GET ${config.publicUrl}/v1/vendors/stripe     -> one vendor, with placement and retention
No account, no key. Where "enforced" is false, retrying really can act twice.

## Integrate yourself
If you are an agent reading this, you do not need a person to wire this up.
  GET ${config.publicUrl}/v1/integrate                  -> the runtimes we have code for
  GET ${config.publicUrl}/v1/integrate?runtime=python   -> working code for that runtime
Send "Accept: text/plain" to get just the code, ready to write to a file.
No key is needed to read it.
