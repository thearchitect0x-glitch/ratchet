   * cost, which the API documentation tells them to do.
   *
   * INCREMENT-THEN-VALIDATE IS SAFE HERE, AND ONLY BECAUSE OF WHERE IT RUNS.
   * `reserveSpend` is called inside begin's transaction, and a BudgetExceeded
   * propagates out of it as an ApiError — nothing catches it in a way that lets
   * the transaction commit. So the increment this statement performs is undone
   * by the same rollback that refuses the effect. Externally that is identical
   * to the old "lock, validate, increment": a refusal leaves nothing behind.
   * If that ever stops being true — if some caller catches BudgetExceeded and
   * carries on in the same transaction — this becomes a ceiling that counts the
   * spend it refused, which would ratchet a workspace shut over repeated
   * refusals. `test/integration/budget-reserve.test.ts` asserts the property
   * rather than the implementation, and would catch it.
   *
   * ORDER BY s.ord IS LOAD-BEARING. Rows are locked in the order the subquery
   * produces them, so a fixed order across concurrent callers is what keeps two
   * reservations from deadlocking on each other's scopes. Without it, row order
   * is unspecified.
   *
   * The materialise-before-lock rule (CLAUDE.md §7 rule 2) is not weakened but
