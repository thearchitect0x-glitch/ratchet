 *
 * Three plans. Free to evaluate, Pro for production, Scale for volume.
 *
 * Scale deliberately collects LESS at a given volume than Pro-plus-overage
 * would: at 250k effects that is $249 against $366. It exists because a
 * variable bill is what triggers a procurement review, and predictable revenue
 * that renews is worth more than a larger invoice that churns.
 *
 * There is no enterprise tier, and adding one would be dishonest today. What
 * enterprises actually buy at that level is an SLA, SSO, and a support
 * commitment — none of which a single-region deployment with no failover and
 * one maintainer can honour. See docs/handoff/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md. Selling it
 * anyway is how a service acquires a customer it then fails.
 *
 * Everything else is free: duplicate suppression, in-flight checks, retries of
 * the same key, outcome reports, reads, policy changes, and webhooks. Callers
 * are never penalised for the retry behaviour the product exists to absorb.
