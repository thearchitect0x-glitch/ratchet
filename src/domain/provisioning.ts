/**
 * Who may conjure a workspace out of nothing.
 *
 * The keyless `begin` is the thing that makes Ratchet usable by an agent that
 * found the service on its own, and it is also the only place a stranger can
 * obtain something of value without presenting anything. Those are the same
 * property, so the answer is not to remove it but to bound it honestly.
 *
 * Two ceilings, because they fail differently:
 *
 *   **Per source** stops the obvious case — one script in a loop. It is keyed
 *   on a hash of the address, so it counts repeat offenders without keeping a
 *   log of who visited. An address is trivially rotated, so this ceiling alone
 *   is close to decorative against anyone deliberate.
 *
 *   **Global** is the one that actually holds. Rotating addresses does not move
 *   it. When it is reached, keyless provisioning stops for everyone and the
 *   caller is told to create a workspace the ordinary way; every request that
 *   presents a key is completely unaffected. That is deliberately the same
 *   shape as the surge containment we sell: stop the cheap unbounded thing,
 *   keep serving everyone who is identified.
 *
 * Both counters live in Postgres. In memory they were per instance and reset on
 * deploy, which made the published limit roughly fictional.
