 * Signed decision receipts.
 *
 * Every product in this category asks you to take its word for it. The evidence
 * that a gate worked is an absence — the charge that did not happen — and an
 * absence cannot be audited. A receipt turns each decision into something the
 * customer can check themselves, offline, against a key we publish.
 *
 * Two properties, deliberately separated because they have different costs:
 *
 *   AUTHORSHIP is proved synchronously. Each receipt is signed the moment the
 *   decision is made. Signing is cheap and needs no lock, so it does not touch
 *   the contention the concurrency work exists to avoid.
 *
 *   COMPLETENESS is proved afterwards. The worker links receipts into a
 *   per-workspace hash chain. A signature alone proves we wrote a receipt; the
 *   chain proves we did not later remove one. Building it inline would need an
 *   exclusive workspace lock on every decision, including the duplicates and
 *   retries that currently skip that lock entirely.
 *
 * The signing key is derived from AUTH_SECRET rather than configured
 * separately, so there is no second secret to lose. The consequence is stated
 * plainly in the docs: rotating AUTH_SECRET rotates the receipt key, and
 * receipts signed under the old one verify only against the old public key.
