 * Vendor-enforced idempotency.
 *
 * Ratchet's gate has always been advisory. It protects you from an agent that
 * asks permission, which is not the agent you are afraid of. A misbehaving
 * agent simply does not call, and nothing here can stop it.
 *
 * This closes that hole by moving enforcement to the one party that cannot be
 * bypassed: the vendor. Ratchet derives the idempotency key the vendor itself
 * will deduplicate on. The caller passes it to Stripe, or Square, or whoever.
 * The duplicate is then refused by the VENDOR, not prevented by our good
 * manners, and it is refused whether or not the agent cooperated with us.
 *
 * Composed with a vendor that honours idempotency keys, at-most-once
 * *initiation* becomes at-most-once *execution at that vendor*. That is not a
 * softening of the rule that exactly-once is unachievable: it is unachievable
 * in general, and this is a compositional guarantee that holds only where the
 * vendor supplies the other half. Where it does not, we say so.
 *
 * THE ATTEMPT NUMBER IS THE SUBTLE PART, and getting it wrong would be worse
 * than not doing this at all.
 *
 * A vendor keyed on idempotency replays the RECORDED RESPONSE for a repeated
 * key, including a recorded failure. So:
 *
 *   Same attempt, retried after a timeout  -> same key -> vendor deduplicates.
 *                                             This is the point: the caller
 *                                             cannot double-charge by retrying.
 *
 *   New attempt, after a reported failure  -> new key -> the vendor genuinely
 *                                             tries again. Reusing the key here
 *                                             would replay the old failure
 *                                             forever and the effect could
 *                                             never succeed.
 *
 * So the attempt counter is part of the derivation. An effect that failed and
 * is being legitimately retried gets a fresh vendor key; a caller retrying the
 * same attempt does not.
 *
 * The key is an HMAC under AUTH_SECRET: deterministic for us, opaque to
 * everyone else. It discloses nothing about the workspace, the effect type, or
 * the caller's own idempotency key, all of which may carry customer
 * identifiers.
